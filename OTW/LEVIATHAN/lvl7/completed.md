So my thoughts, the challenges are fun to pass time by but they lack structure to teach proper
foundation on the technique.

You should note that this was an old resource but the information is still valid. But currently
in the information era there are many resources you can use like [pwn.college](https://pwn.college/)
or the [bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) challs if you just need to learn linux.

!! Adios !!
