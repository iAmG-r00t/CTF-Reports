### Challenge

- Level Goal: Same as Level0 but this time rightclicking has been disabled.

### How I did it

- You can view the web source in two different ways apart from rightclicking.
- In google chrome you can use the keyboard shortcut which is `Ctrl + u` which will open the page source in a new tab.
  - The other way you could use a keyboard shortuct `F12` to open the **DevTools** in a new window.

### Conclusion / To Note

> If any please note them down here, if not leave it blank.
