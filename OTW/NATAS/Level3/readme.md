### Challenge

- Level Goal: Get the password for the next Level.

### How I did it

- We are introduced with the same message as before; `There is nothing on this page.`
- When I checked the page source there was a comment saying; `No more information leaks!! Not even Google will find it this time....`
- Well being Level3 I thought of the simplicity of the challenge.
- Bing!! Bing!! Bing!! ... I then remembered about the `robots.txt` file, which according to the mozilla MDN Web Docs states it is a file which is usually placed in the root of any website. It decides whether crawlers are permitted or forbidden access to the web site.
- **!! BOOM !!** we find our data leak.

### Conclusion / To Note
