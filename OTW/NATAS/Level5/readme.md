### Challenge

- Level Goal: Get the password for the next Level.

### How I did it

- We are presented with a web page informing us `Access disallowed.` That we are not logged in.
- After some review I checked around and noticed that from our local stored Cookies there was a Cookie under the URL named `loggedin` with the value `0`.
  - I changed the value from `0` to `1`, refreshed the web page and we got our password for the next challenge.

### Conclusion / To Note

> If any please note them down here, if not leave it blank.
