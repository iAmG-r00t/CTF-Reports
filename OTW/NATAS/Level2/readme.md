### Challenge

- Level Goal: Well the main goal is to find the password to the next level.

### How I did it

- We are introduced with a web page saying; `There is nothing on this page.`
- After a long time of looking through the web source I noticed there is a files directory where a `pixel.png` file has been stored at.
- I entered the files directory name at the base URL; `$URL/files/` and we are met with a directory listing where we are be able to see a `users.txt` file that contains the password for the next Level.

### Conclusion / To Note
