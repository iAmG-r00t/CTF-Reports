### Challenge

- Level Goal: Get the password for the next challenge.

### How I did it

- This challenge is almost the same as for [Level6](../Level6/readme.md) but this time the secret key is encoded multiple times but I was able to decode it in a jiffy using some online site by google known as [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/), check it out it's an awesome tool.
- **!! BOOM !!** we got the password for the next Level after submitting the decoded secret key.

### Conclusion / To Note

> If any please note them down here, if not leave it blank.
