### Challenge

- More Git stuff to learn about.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- Basically I already gave you two resource in [Level27](../Level27/readme.md#conclusion--to-note)
- But for those who need a clue, just know git also contains branches knows as `branch`. They also have local and remote branches.
- Give it a try, you will learn alot.

- ~~The flag is at the home directory in the `readme.md` file.~~
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note

> If any please note them down here, if not leave it blank.
