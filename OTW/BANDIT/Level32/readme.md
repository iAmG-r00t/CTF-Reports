### Challenge

- Finally we are done with the Git stuff, the main goal of this challenge was to learn more escape techniques.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- So for a new linux user this challenge might seem hard, to make it more easier for you I will just inform you that in a linux system if one wants to know what shell someone is using we usually run this command; `echo $0`.
- The `$0` is a bash special character which expands to the name of the shell or shell script.
- Read more from the [Bash Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html).


- The flag is at the `/etc/bandit_pass` directory, `bandit34` file.
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note
