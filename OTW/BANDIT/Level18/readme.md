### Challenge

- The main goal of this challenge was to execute a command remotely through ssh.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- Basically we can't login because we are being disconnected at every instance we try to login so we execute a command to read the flag in the home directory.

- The flag is at the home directory in the `readme.md` file.
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note
