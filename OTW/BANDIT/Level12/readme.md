### Challenge

- The main goal of this challenge was to decode a hexdump, then decompress alot of files.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- I won't provide any solution here for this because it is an easy challenge and I will let you enjoy solving it.
- Although I will point out that the `file` command and [Google](https://google.com) should be your best friends.
- Remember hexdump and multiple compressed data files.
- Also create a directory in the `/tmp` folder and copy the `data.txt` file there and work with it from there.

- The flag will be the last decompressed file.
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note

> If any please note them down here, if not leave it blank.
