### Challenge

- The main goal of this challenge was to extended the teaching lesson on `cron`; the time-based job scheduler.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- I think it will be fair if I see all I did was code review and running some few commands.
- You got this, give it a try.
- Also remember to read and understand the Level Goal.

- Trust me you will find the flag.
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note

> If any please note them down here, if not leave it blank.
