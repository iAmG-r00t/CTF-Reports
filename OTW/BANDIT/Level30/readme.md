### Challenge

- More Git Stuff to learn about.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- This was an interesting challenge.
- The clue is tags. Git has the ability to tag specific points in a repository as being important.
- Now go solve the damn challenge.

- ~~The flag is at the home directory in the `readme.md` file.~~
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note

> If any please note them down here, if not leave it blank.
