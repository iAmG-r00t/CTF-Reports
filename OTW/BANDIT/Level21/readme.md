### Challenge

- The main goal for this challenge was to learn about `cron`; the time-based scheduler.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- Well give it a try, I will give you a clue try and see if the cron job already did it work after reboot.

- You will find the flag where its supposed to be at.
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note

> If any please note them down here, if not leave it blank.
