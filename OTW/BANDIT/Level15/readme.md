### Challenge

- The main goal of this challenge was to learn how to submit the password of the current level to port `30001` on localhost using SSL encryption.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- I learnt about testing with `openssl` from this challenge, this is something refreshing.
- I wouldn't want to bust the bubble for you, give it a try.


- The flag is the output given after submitting the current password to the specified port.
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note
