### Challenge

- The goal of this challenge was to learn how to exploit a bug in `more` command and how to get a shell from a texteditor.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- So the first way of how I approached this challenge was wrong, I never thought through of what was required but here I am teaching you the proper way of how to approach this challenge.
- So the level goal informs us that Logging in to bandit26 from bandit25 should be fairly easy, and that's true because there is an ssh key at the home directory.
- But there is a catch, the shell for user `bandit26` is not `\bin\bash`, but something else, we are to find out what it is, how it works and how to break out of it.
- So first our main goal is to get to know what user shell bandit26 is using. The straight and quick method to do this is to check the `/etc/passwd` file and grep for user `bandit26` and see what shell he has been assinged.
- If you have done the above step, I think you know what you should do next. View the contexts of that file in that directory.
- So from here on I wouldn't want to show you the whole solution and make it les fun, so here is a clue before you try to login to user `bandit26` please reduce the size of your terminal to be really small, then login.
- You will see something interesting, so read the following [blog](https://www.sans.org/blog/escaping-restricted-linux-shells/), It will assist in helping you solve this solution. A very interesting one indeed.
- Also do research on how to escalate `more` command preview to a text editor.
- Google should be your best friend, also once you are done you will have access to a shell for bandit26.

- This level does not require a flag, the flag is the shell for the next level.
