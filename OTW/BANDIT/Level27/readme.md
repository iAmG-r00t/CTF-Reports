### Challenge

- The main goal of this challenge was to learn about git.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- Well... well.... well... seems like I have no comment for this challenge.
- This challenge is straight forward, so just solve it and enjoy the ride.


- The flag is in the git reposiroty you just cloned.
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.
