### Challenge

- The main goal of this challenge was to learn Git.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- Did the same way, as I solved the [previous level](../Level27/readme.md).
- If you watched the 4 hour video I had linked, I think you know what to do.
- For those who don't just know that git also has logs. ðŸ§  âž• ðŸ’» = ðŸ¤¯ðŸ’£

- ~~The flag is at the home directory in the `readme.md` file.~~
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note

> If any please note them down here, if not leave it blank.
