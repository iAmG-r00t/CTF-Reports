### Challenge

- The main goal for this challenge was to login the the user `bandit14` to get the password for the next level that was located in `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14`.
- We were provided the `target host` to connect to, `port` to use, `username` and `password` for authentication.

### How I did it

- We were provided with a private ssh key at the home directory.
- This is an easy challenge, please [Google](https://google.com):`How to login with SSH using a private key file`
- Also remember they give a **note** that `localhost` is a hostname that refers to the machine you are working on.
- Proceed solving this, its soo easy.

- The flag is at `/etc/bandit_pass/bandit14` file path.
- **Note:** The *flag* is the `password` for the next level.

### Conclusion / To Note
