## OVERTHEWIRE - (OTW) Quests

> This is an update for the [BANDIT](./OTW/BANDIT/) CTF folder.

- First of all, the old pdfs are still there in a new directory called [pdf0-26](./BANDIT/pdf_0-26)
- I will be creating folders for each Level and within there you will find a `readme.md` file that will consist of notes and my thought process on how I solved that level.
- Do not I am doing this at my free time, so github updates may be slow.. we are not sure how much free time I may be having. :smile:
- I will also not post the flag in there.
- The **main** Goal of doing this is for me to measure my linux skills and to have fun and maybe learn something new that I may have forgotten or slipped by when doing this challenges those old years ago.
- !! - Thank you - !!
