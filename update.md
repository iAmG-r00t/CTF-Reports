## OVERTHEWIRE - (OTW) Quests

> This is an update for the [BANDIT](./OTW/BANDIT/) CTF.

- **Start Date:** `November 26th 2020`
- I will be creating folders for each Level and within there you will find a `readme.md` file that will consist of notes and my thought process on how I solved that level.
- I am doing these challenges at my free time, so github updates may be slow.. we are not sure how much free time I may be having. :smile:
- I will also not place any flags in the readme files.
- The **main** Goals of re-doing these challenges is to refresh my linux skills, have fun and maybe learn something new that I may have forgotten from the year 2017 when I did them.
- **End Date:** `January 14th 2021`

> This an update for the [NATAS](./OTW/NATAS) CTF.

- **Start Date:** `January 14th 2021`
- In 2017 I tried doing these challenges but I gave up because I never knew any web application skills.
- I am going to arrange them, the same way I have done for [bandit](./OTW/BANDIT/) challenges.
- The same rule applies for the flags.
- This will be interesting because I am not that proficient with web application, I am sooo eager to learn a few new things here and there.
- Main goal is to learn Web application, these time I will try and explain the process or any other technical term really well from a noobs perspective.

- 😊 Do enjoy 😊
- ❕ Thank you ❕
